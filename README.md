* I am working on a openVR version of LoadingScreenPictures so people can use it without breaking VRChat TOS.
* It will be posted here when ready. Sorry for the inconveniences.
* Vibrator Controller: I recommend just using the app as you normally would or you can put the app on a android emulator and control it using XROverlay. You could also check out RealFeel or VibeGoBrrr
* Dear vrchat: please add loading screen pictures to the game, it would be cool :)
