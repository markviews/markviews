### Hi there 👋

<!--
**markviews/markviews** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- 📝 Discord: MarkViews#0001
- I am working on openVR versions of LoadingScreenPictures and VibratorController so people can use them without breaking VRChat TOS.
- Also i'll verify this dosen't break TOS first, but i'll remake invite+ fix using vrchatapi.
They will be posted here when ready. Sorry for the inconveniences.
Dear vrchat: please add loading screen pictures to the game, it would be cool :)
